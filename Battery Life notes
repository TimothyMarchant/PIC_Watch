To preface, most sources for power come from a parts datasheet, so each part will be listed with its current consumption, and we will compute the battery life span here.
PIC16F15225 SLEEP : <600 nA @ 3 volts
PIC16f15225 Running @ 4 MHz : <1 mA.  @ 5 volts
But we are running it at 32 MHz which is 8 times faster than 4 MHz, but I'd imagine current consumption is nonlinear, so for now we will say it consumes 8mA we may change to 1 MHz after this 
(the PIC only has three internal oscilators; 32MHz, 1MHz, 32KHz),
MCP7940N : 1.2 uA
MCP9700 : 6 uA (but this is barely on, so we don't really consider it).
SSD 1306 (ON) :  8.1 mA for 50% of the screen lit up at constrast set to 127 (taken from here https://bitbanksoftware.blogspot.com/2019/06/how-much-current-do-oled-displays-use.html).
To compute the average current consumption we must compute all possible current consumptions.
DEEP_SLEEP: only two things are on in this state, the PIC and the MCP7940N.  Therefore current<1.2+0.6=1.8 microamps.
Light_SLEEP: In this state the screen is active, but the PIC is in sleep and the MCP7940N is running.  Therefore current<1.2+0.6+8100=8101.8 micro amps.
Active:  The same as before, but the PIC is running: Then we have current<1000+8100+1.2=9101.2 micro amps.
We do not consider other active states since they're negliable and we are partially overestimating other states, so it should work out.
We can make certain assumptions about the activity of the watch.  Most of the time the watch will be in deep sleep.  Realistcally a user might check at most 5 minutes a day, sometimes less.  
We also will assume the user is not making changes in the settings.  It's only on the first powerup.
So we consider three cases, the user checks 5 minutes a day, 3 minutes a day, and 1.5 minutes a day or that is 0.35% of the day, 0.21%, or 0.10%.  Further more, the PIC is realistically in sleep most of that time say at least 50% of the time.
Therefore, for case 1: AVG current consumption (5 mins) is less than (0.175%*Active+0.175%*Light_Sleep)+DEEP_SLEEP*99.65%
For case 2 (3 minutes): we have (0.105%*Active+0.105%*Light_Sleep)+DEEP_SLEEP*99.79%
For case 3 (1.5 minutes): we have (0.05%*Active+0.05%*LightSleep)+Deep_Sleep*99.90%
case 1<31.90, case 2<19.8, case 3<10.4 where each is in micro amps.
This is the average current consumption.
Now we will assume that each case has some probability of being selected.  For this problem we will assume the user is equally likely for all three cases.
Then the average current consumption in general is 1/3*(case 1 +case 2+ case 3)=20.7 micro amps.  However recall that we are over estimating current consumption, then we can say the average consumption is <20.7uA.
A CR2032 usually has a capacity of 230 MAh.  So the life span would be 230000/20.7=11111.111 hours or at least 1 year (1.268 years).
In short the expected battery life would be a little over a year.  Granted if the user barely checks the time, then this clearly would be much longer.
For a more optimal expected life span suppose the user checks 1.5 mins a day >95% of the time, so the average consumption is approximately 10.4 uA.  Then 230000/10.4 = 22115.385 hours or 2.5 years.
For the nonoptimal case, suppose it's 5 minutes a day >95% of the time.  Then approximately it's 230000/31.90=7210 hours or 10 months.
To conclude we can say for the average user the life span is around 1.268 years, the best case is 2.5 years, and the worst case is 10 months.  
Obviously we are assuming the user is not forgetting to turn the watch into sleep mode.  But this is a good approximation.
