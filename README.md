# PIC_Watch
A digital watch that tells the time and temperature.  It uses the PIC15225 microcontroller.  The screen is a 0.96 inch OLED (SSD1306).  
The purpose of this project was to make an actual embedded application because I was in need of a watch.  

Here are some pictures from start to finish.
