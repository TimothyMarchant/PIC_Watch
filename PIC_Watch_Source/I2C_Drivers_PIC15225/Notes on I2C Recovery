I have very limited abilities to actually cause intentional bus hangs, but I was able to cause a few lockups intentionally. 
in the case of SCL being stuck high and SDA being stuck low, the implemented recovery method works with a reset of the microcontroller. 
This hangup was caused by me repeatly resetting the device in mid communication until the line went low.  
the following c code was used to test the recovery method.
if (PORTCbits.RC1==0){
        bitbangrecovery();
        RESET();
    }
    else if (PORTCbits.RC1==1&&PORTCbits.RC0==0){
        bitbangrecovery();
        RESET();
    }
This method sends 9 pulses according to the I2C specifications (3.1.16).
This is meant to avoid turning everything off.  The specifications do state if the SCL line is stuck low then we must cycle the power for the I2C parts.
